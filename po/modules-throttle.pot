msgid "The congestion control throttle can be automatically enabled when the number of anonymous users currently visiting your site exceeds the specified threshold. For example, to start the throttle when your site has 250 anonymous users online at once, enter '250' in this field. Leave this value blank or set to \"0\" if you do not wish to auto-throttle on anonymous users. You can inspect the current number of anonymous users using the \"Who's online\" block."

msgid "The auto-throttle probability limiter is an efficiency mechanism to statistically reduce the overhead of the auto-throttle. The limiter is expressed as a percentage of page views, so for example if set to the default of 10% we only perform the extra database queries to update the throttle status 1 out of every 10 page views. The busier your site, the lower you should set the limiter value."

msgid "The throttle module provides a congestion control mechanism that automatically adjusts to a surge in incoming traffic. If your site is referenced by a popular website, or experiences a \"Denial of Service\" (DoS) attack, your webserver might become overwhelmed. The throttle mechanism is utilized by modules to temporarily disable CPU-intensive functionality, increasing performance. For instance, via the throttle module, modules may choose to disable resource-intensive blocks or the code within the site theme may temporarily disable user pictures in posts."
